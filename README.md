# GADS 2020 Practice Project (Cloud Track)

This is my submission of the practice project for Phase 2 of the Google Africa Developer Scholarship Program 2020. 

The Cloud challenge is divided in two parts:  

* Completion of 10-15 selected hands-on labs on Qwiklabs and submitting proof of such per screenshot based on the email received.
* “Translation” of 2-3 selected labs from Console instructions to 100% command line instructions.

The result of both challenges should be documented in a Github repository.
